## Config <a name='config'></a>
We need to know few things about your library. This is so we know what folders to look at for new media items.


## Setup for automation <a name='setup'></a>
There are some settings that need to be set for seasonedParser to be able to find and rename new files. 

### Download directory <a name='download-directory'></a>
In your download client set a incomplete folder and a complete directory. This will allow seasonedParser to only parse items that have been completely downloaded.

*TODO:* Monitor multiple folders at the same time.
